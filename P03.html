            &nbsp;   The Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old.[1] It formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud. <br>
            Most of this matter gathered in the center, and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
            It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.<br>
            &nbsp;   The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9% of the Solar System's mass. <br> This means that it has strong gravity. <br>
            The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium.
